I've successfully implemented Node.js to create a powerful E-Commerce REST API with MongoDB as the database.
I've developed models that drive the functionality of the API. These include the essential entities such as cart, order, product, and user, which ensure seamless management of data and enhance the overall user experience.
Furthermore, I've crafted efficient routes for each of these models, ensuring smooth navigation and interactions. The routes comprise cart, order, product, user, as well as auth and verifytokenmiddleware for added security and authorization layers.I have incorporated JWT (JSON Web Tokens) into the API. This implementation enables secure transmission of information and faster authorization, enhancing the API's interoperability with external applications and services.
With Postman, I conducted thorough tests on various endpoints, including cart, order, product, and user. The API responded flawlessly, demonstrating the reliability and robustness of the implementation.
